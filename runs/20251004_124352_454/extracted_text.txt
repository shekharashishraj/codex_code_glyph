The increase in live inventories is attributable to an increase in the quantity of live birds in inventory at the Company's Tyler, 
Texas facility as it increased production during fiscal 2019, as well as the value at which the Company's live poultry 
inventories of broilers are recorded. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a 
marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, 
the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age 
subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to 
a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales 
proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The 
significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include 
estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge 
of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on 
hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value. 
The increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an 
increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.  
The increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 
31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken 
facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared 
chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds 
of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.
