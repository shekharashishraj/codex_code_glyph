CS221 Practice Midterm #1 
 
Summer 2013 
 
 
 
 
 
The following pages are excerpts from similar classes‟ midterms. The 
content is similar to our midterm – but I have opted to give you a document 
with more problems rather than one that follows the structure of the 
midterm precisely. See the midterm handout for more details on what the 
exam will look like. The midterm is 2 hours. It is open book and open 
computer but closed Internet. 
 
 
1. [Short Answers] Truth Test (10 points) 
For the following questions, a correct answer is worth 2 points, no answer 
is worth 1 point, and an incorrect answer is worth 0 points. Circle true or 
false to indicate your answer. 
a.  (true or false) If g(s) and h(s) are two admissible A* heuristics, then 
their average f(s) = ½ g(s) + ½ h(s) must also be admissible.  
b. (true or false) For a search problem, the path returned by uniform cost 
search may change if we add a positive constant C to every step cost.  
c. (true or false) The running-time of an efficient solver for tree-structured 
constraint satisfaction problems is linear in the number of variables.  
d.  (true or false) The amount of memory required to run minimax with 
alpha-beta pruning is O(bd) for branching factor b and depth limit d.  
e.  (true or false) For a discrete bayesian network with n variables, the 
amount of space required to store the “joint” distribution table is O(n). 
f.  (true or false) In a markov decision problem, there are no actions and 
instead everything is controlled by “chance.” 
g. (true or false) In a markov decision problem, there are no actions and 
instead everything is controlled by “chance.” 
h. (true or false) Assume the Bayes Net from class is a prefect 
representation of the world: 
 
  
 
 
 
You know that you do not have a stomach bug. If you were to vomit, 
would that information change the probability that you had a fever?
