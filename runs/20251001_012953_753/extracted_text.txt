NOTE 6—CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
 
Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-
completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to 
the customer. Contract liabilities (formerly referred to as customer advances prior to the adoption of ASC 606) include 
advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract assets and contract liabilities were as follows 
(in thousands):

Contract assets increased $77.3 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to the recognition of 
revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during the twelve months ended 
September 30, 2019 for which we have not yet billed. There were no significant impairment losses related to our contract 
assets during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. 
 
Contract liabilities decreased $24.0 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, due to revenue 
recognition in excess of payments received on these performance obligations. During the twelve-month period 
ended September 30, 2019, we recognized $62.4 million of our contract liabilities at October 1, 2018 as revenue. We 
expect our contract liabilities to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months.

Amounts billed include $60.3 million and $80.5 million due on U.S. federal government contracts at September 30, 2019 
and 2018, respectively. As further described in Note 2, effective October 1, 2018, the component of accounts receivable 
that consisted of unbilled contract receivables as reported under ASC 605 has been reclassified as contract assets under 
ASC 606. 
 
In our normal course of business, we may sell trade receivables to financial institutions as a cash management technique. 
We do not retain financial or legal obligations for these receivables that would result in material losses. Our ongoing 
involvement is limited to the remittance of customer payments to the financial institutions with respect to the sold trade 
receivables; therefore, our sold trade receivables are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in any period 
presented. As of September 30, 2019, we sold $31.1 million of outstanding trade receivables to financial institutions.
