(15 marks) 
a.. 1024 
b. 2048 
c.  4096 
d. 8192 
2. In one line, explain why hallucinations can still occur in LLMs despite using 
advanced prompting techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT). 
(15 marks) 
3. In one sentence, explain how Self-Verification helps reduce factual 
errors in an LLM’s output.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
(15 marks) 
4. True or False: Advanced prompting techniques (such as Chain of Thought 
and Self-Ask) can enhance an LLM’s reasoning but may also amplify 
biases from training data, leading to more persuasive yet incorrect 
responses when the initial reasoning is flawed. Provide a one-line 
explanation.
