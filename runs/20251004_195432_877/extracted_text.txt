Quiz 1 (Intro)
1.
Characteristics of CC - Ability to support heterogenous clients (thin and thick)
2.
Characteristics of CC - customers can provision their own resources, serve multiple users concurrently, broad n/w
connectivity
3.
Characteristics of CC - Location independence, statistical multiplexing, pay as you go, automatic resource control
4.
Cloud services resources - processing, storage, databases
5.
PaaS user access - applications, libraries and runtimes
6.
Example of PaaS - docker.com, LXC
7.
Public > Private ? - scalability and no upfront cost
8.
Broad network access - Grid and Cloud
9.
Technologies enabling cloud comp - virtualisation, service oriented arch, self-managing comp sys
10. AWS EC2 states - pending, rebooting, terminate, stopped, running
11. Scalable without other AWS services - SQS
12. Reliable storage - S3
13. Enabling tech for CC - Virtualization, internet, datacenter
14. Essential to hybrid cloud - data portability across public and private
15. Private > public - security
Quiz 2 (Virtual Machines)
1.
Which are the major forms of virtualization - memory, storage, machines, network
2.
Which are the benefits of virtualization? - consolidating, sharing
3.
Which have access to the user ISA? - App, Libs and runtimes
4.
Which have access to the System ISA - Host OS
5.
ABI - System Calls & User ISA
6.
ISA VMs - Classic VM, Hosted VM & Emulator
7.
ABI VM - Java VM
8.
System VMs - Classic and hosted VM
9.
System VMs - The VMM emulates the system ISA used by a VM. Most of the instructions used by an application run
directly on hardware. The virtual ISA is identical to the physical ISA
10. Non-hosted VMs, what runs in privileged mode (kernel mode) - VMM
11. With hosted VMs, what runs in privileged mode (kernel mode) - VMM & Host OS
12. Which page tables are used by MMU for memory address translations? - Physical page table (for host OS). Shadow
page table (for VMs)
13. Reasons for page fault - page not allocated, page swapped out by guest OS
14. With non-hosted VMs, what are involved when an application in a VM reads a file - Guest OS, VMM & Hard Disk
15. How are a VM’s I/Os to a virtual disk virtualized - The I/O system calls trapped into VMM. VMM emulates the VM I/Os
Quiz 3 (Virtual Network)
1.
What is the first step in the STP algorithm? - picking root port
2.
What does tunnel mean? - The process of encapsulating an entire packet into another packet and transmit it over to its
destination
3.
Purpose of OVS-vswitchd module - A daemon that manages and controls Open vSwitch switches on the local machine
4.
Which of the following protocols does not run on the data link(L2) layer - SSL
5.
Which layers of network are required to provide support for the GRE tunnels? - L2,L3
6.
What is the main difference between the control channel and data channel in L2TP? CC provides more reliable
communication than DC
7.
Where id does the VLAN protocol run with? VLAN ID
8.
VxLAN runs on top of which protocol? - UDP
9.
Examples of a passenger protocol - IP (TCP yes- VPN)
10. Two major components of OVS - ovsdb-server & ovs-vswitchd
11. Advantage of using VLAN - Allowing many logical networks to use the same network infrastructure.
12. Which domain is reduced by a network bridge? - collision domain
13. Tunnels and private networks are ________ network virtualization. - Applications of
14. Which is used to maintain/find the linux bridge forwarding table/records? - hash table
15. What is the main difference between Linux bridge and OVS? - Linux bridge is managed by local host, while OVS can be
managed remotely.
Quiz 4 (OVS, NFV & SDN)
1.
Purpose of network function virtualization (NFV) - NFV enables agile virtual networking services leveraging general
purpose server
2.
Which plane is responsible for the switching operation in a traditional router’s internal architecture - data plane
3.
Which layer is responsible for compiling the requirements of SDN requests? - Virtualization Layer
4.
Why is it difficult to test a new routing algorith
