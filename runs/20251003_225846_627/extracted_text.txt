Question 1 
The following is the “line-angle” drawing of melanin, a pigment that determines hair color.  Note: The 
carbon (C) and the hydrogen (H) atoms are not shown but implied. 
a) Clearly label ALL C and H atoms on the line angle drawing and 
write the molecular formula of melanin in the space below. 
b) On the line angle drawing, box one nonpolar functional group and 
circle all electronegative elements. 
c) Do you think melanin would dissolve in water? Why or why not? 
Question 2 
There are two types of melanin pigment in hair follicles: pheomelanin (which promotes red or blond 
hair color) and eumelanin (which promotes black or brown hair color). The following is the simplified 
outline of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis. 
a) The E1-E5 catalyzed reactions proceed spontaneously in the 
forward direction (shown by an •) and NOT in the reverse direction 
(shown by •) within a cell. Explain why this is so. 
b) You identify three individuals: Individual A lacks a functional E2, 
Individual B has a hyperactive form of E3 enzyme and Individual C 
has a functional E5 but lacks a functional E4. 
i. 
Which metabolite(s) would build up in the melanin synthesizing 
cells of Individual A? 
ii. 
Which metabolite(s) would build up in the melanin synthesizing cells of Individual B? 
iii. 
What would be the hair color of Individual C? Explain your choice assuming that cysteine is 
present.

Question 2 continued 
c) Which class of macromolecules is cysteine a monomer of: carbohydrates/ lipids/ nucleic acids/ 
proteins? Briefly explain why cysteine is different from other monomers that make the class of 
macromolecules that you chose. 
Question 3 
a) Complete the statements below by choosing from the following: the same/ higher/ lower. The 
reaction catalyzed by a hypoactive form of E3 (1000- fold less active than the normal form of E3) has … 
i. 
_______________ free energy change as the reaction catalyzed by normal E3. 
ii. 
_______________ reaction rate compared to the reaction catalyzed by normal E3. 
iii. 
_______________ reaction equilibrium compared to the reaction catalyzed by normal E3 
iv. 
_______________ activation energy compared to the reaction catalyzed by normal E3 
b) For the E3 catalyzed step, the free energy change (ΔG) = -1.8 kcals/mole. 
i. 
The E3 catalyzed reaction is 
exergonic/ endergonic reaction. 
an example of an 
ii. 
On the left, draw the energy profile of the reaction 
catalyzed by E3. Label the reactants (R), products (P), 
ΔG and activation energy (EAC) of the reaction. 
c) E3 is optimally active at pH 7.4 and 37OC. If the same E3­
catalyzed reaction were conducted in vitro (in a test tube) at 
pH 7.4 and 50OC, would you expect to see more/ less/ the 
same level of melanin synthesis? Explain why. Note: 
Provide an explanation with respect to the three dimensional 
(3D-) conformation of E3 enzyme. Your expl
