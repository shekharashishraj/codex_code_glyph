1. Docker screenshot
  
 
2.  Mockaroo json dataset creation screenshot
 
3. Insert the data using insert_many
 
4. Total number of orders and total orders grouped by state
 
5. Product and their frequencies
 
6. Orders where amount is greater than 1000 and in California 
 
7. 10 states with amount exceeding more than 500
 
8. Customers with order more than 2000
 
9. New York orders on 10/21/2021
 
10. The aggregation pipelines helps us perform operations with a sequential ﬂow where 
in the ﬁrst step we extract the data , then load it and then perform tranformations 
like an etl piepline. 
a. $match : this is used to ﬁlter the documents 
b. $sort: we use this to display the fetched result in the desired 
order(ASC/DESC) 
And similarly we have others like sort, limit etc. 
 
 
 
Here each state takes documents from the initial query as input , applies sorting based on 
greater than condition operations then provides the result back to the customer. 
also ﬁnd_order_totals function  uses $group to combine orders per state after counting the 
collection and then uses $sort puts the states in ascending order.
