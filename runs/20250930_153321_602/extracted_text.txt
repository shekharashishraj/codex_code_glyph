Motivation: Multinational corporations operate in diverse locations and manage multiple 
projects simultaneously. Tracking employees, responsibilities, project budgets, and 
compensation across regions requires a robust relational database. A well-structured 
design ensures accurate reporting, reduces redundancy, and supports efficient decision-
making at a global scale. 
Problem Statement: You are hired as a database designer for a multinational company 
that manages projects across several countries. Each project may be located in a different 
city or country and requires employees with specific job titles and responsibilities. 
Employees can be assigned to multiple projects at once, sometimes in different regions, 
with varying durations. Salaries are standardized by job title but may need to be compared 
across projects and locations for analysis. The company wants to, 
• Maintain clear relationships among employees, projects, assignments, and 
salaries. 
• Avoid redundancy and anomalies by using proper normalization. 
• Support complex queries for reporting, including identifying global staffing 
patterns, comparing budgets, and analyzing labor costs across multiple locations. 
The schema includes the following four relations: 
• EMP(ENO, ENAME, TITLE) 
• ASG(ENO, PNO, RESP, DUR) 
• PROJ(PNO, PNAME, BUDGET, LOC) 
• PAY(TITLE, SAL) 
Intuition: Employees (EMP) work on projects (PROJ). Their assignments are recorded 
in ASG with a responsibility (RESP) and a duration in months (DUR). Titles map to 
salaries through the PAY relation. 
 
 
Q1. Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) - Draw an ERD illustrating the relational 
database schema. Show entities and attributes, primary key, foreign key, relationships, 
and cardinalities. (5 points) 
Q2. Relational Schema Definition – Define and explain the terms - relation, attributes 
and tuples, primary key, foreign key, and integrity constraints in the context of the given 
schema. (5 points) 
Q3. Normalization - Provide two normalization cases to avoid redundancy and anomalies 
in the context of the given schema. (5 Points) 
For each,  
• State the functional dependency or anomaly 
• Explain the normalization step (1NF/2NF/3NF) 
• Describe how this improves the design. 
Q4. Write at least five queries for the given schema. For each query, provide a natural 
language description of what the query should return, and its equivalent SQL expression. 
You may choose your queries from the list of operations below, but each query must use 
a different operation (no repeats): (5 Points) 
• Relational Algebra operations: Selection, Union, Set Difference, Cartesian 
Product, Insertion, Theta (θ)–Join, Semi-join, Division 
 
Submission Instruction: 
• Submit a single PDF file containing the complete solutions for Q1–Q4. 
• All solutions must be handwritten (digital handwriting, e.g., stylus, iPad, OneNote, 
is also acceptable). 
• Typed answers will not be accepted.  
• You may scan or take clear photos of your work. (Unclear photos used will be 
rejected.) 
• The ER Diagram may be either drawn by hand or created digitally using any 
appropriate diagramming tool.
